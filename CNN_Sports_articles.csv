That is simply sensational from Inter Milan keeper Yann Sommer.
Lamine Yamal cuts in from the right and looks to curl a shot into the far corner. Most people in the San Siro thought it was heading in, but Sommer springs into action and tips the effort around the post.
That could be a game-winning stop. Less than five minutes left.

Wojciech Szczęsny keeps Barcelona in the game
From CNN's Matias Grez
Barça goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny has just produced a great save to keep his team in the game.
It looked as though Davide Frattesi was going to score almost a carbon copy of his goal at the other end of the pitch, but Szczęsny got down quickly to tip the ball behind for a corner.
What a tie we’re witnessing.

There must be some really tired legs out there, but Inter and Barcelona are still going for it.
Sometimes, you get the sense that both teams are just waiting for extra-time to end and playing for penalties – but that’s certainly not the case today.
The San Siro has been rocking since Davide Frattesi put Inter back in front and you would expect the second half of extra-time to be all Barcelona as Hansi Flick’s side go in search of another equalizer in this incredible tie.
Although, I’ve given up predicting what might happen next in this tie.

INCREDIBLE SCENES!
Inter Milan was just a few minutes from being knocked out of the Champions League and now it finds itself ahead in this stunning semifinal!
It was brilliant hold up play by striker Marcus Thuram who lays the ball off to Davide Frattesi. The midfielder keeps his composure in the box to guide his shot into the corner of the net.
The San Siro is rocking and it’s even started to rain. What drama!

Champions League semifinal goes into extra-time
From CNN's Ben Church and Matias Grez
Enjoy the first 90 minutes? Luckily, we have another 30 minutes of extra-time to look forward to.
The referee brings regulation play to an end with the scores all level at 6-6 on aggregate.
It’s been a brilliant second half from Barcelona, but the visitor will be frustrated it couldn’t hold on for a few minutes at the end.
Inter Milan will be feeling energized now after looking like it was on the brink of being knocked out. What a thrilling 30 minutes we’re in for.

You’ll never believe it, but Inter Milan has found a last-minute equalizer out of nowhere!
It looked as though Barcelona had broken Inter hearts with that late Raphinha goal, but the host wasn’t finished.
Despite being second-best all second half, Inter’s Denzel Dumfries breaks through yet again and set up Francesco Acerbi who smashed his effort into the roof of the net.
At 37, Acerbi is the oldest player on the pitch and he can barely believe what he’s just done.
This is why we all love the Beautiful Game!

It’s a cliché I know, but this really has been a game of two halves.
The first 45 minutes were all Inter Milan, with the home side limiting Barcelona to half chances.
But whatever was said to the Barça players at the break has worked because it’s been all them in the second half.
Inter players are struggling to deal with the occasion at the moment and it’s now just wave after wave of
Blaugrana
attacks.
Lamine Yamal almost produced something special just then, but his shot was well-saved.
A little more than 10 minutes remaining here, with extra-time looming.

VAR saves Inter Milan from a Barcelona penalty!
From CNN's Matias Grez
An error at the back results in Henrikh Mkhitaryan bringing down Lamine Yamal, and referee Szymon Marciniak points to the penalty spot.
However, a brief VAR review shows Mkhitaryan first made contact with Yamal just outside the penalty area. And I mean
just
.
Even Marciniak makes a gesture with his fingers to indicate how small the margin was.
A collective sigh of relief is expelled inside the San Siro after the free kick comes to nothing.

Blaugrana
have certainly delivered.
In less than six minutes, Barça has scored two goals to level the tie – a repeat of what happened in the first leg!

Wow! What an incredible five minutes in Milan.
Gerard Martín is now causing Inter real trouble with his deliveries into the box, and he’s just whipped in another delightful cross for Dani Olmo to head home the equalizer for Barcelona!
That’s two assists in five minutes for the defender.
This game is following the same pattern as the first leg, with Inter taking a 2-0 lead and being pegged back on both occasions.

I was just about to write that Barcelona was yet to trouble this organized Inter defense – then up pops Eric García.
The defender wandered late into the box and caught Gerard Martín’s cross perfectly on his instep, firing the ball into the top corner.
Game on!
