Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war – and prefigured current fantasy art.
On a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil.
The spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition,
Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London
, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from the
De Morgan Foundation
, as well as two
newly-restored paintings
and two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991.

The show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to a
rising interest
in this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William – a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designer
William Morris
– and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt and
Dante Gabriel Rossetti
. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife.
[The paintings] convey the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives
Yet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than those
depicted by her contemporaries
, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais'
Ophelia
, or figures whose main currency was
their looks
, we meet a skilled
sorceress creating magical potions
and
flying superheroines
who can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers.
These goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such as
Boreas and Oreithyia
(1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo.
In Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli's
The Birth of Venus
(1483–1485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth − reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife − then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: a
dark angel bearing a scythe
,
sea monsters
or – more obliquely –
a sand timer
. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives.

""During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected,"" Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. ""Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days,"" she points out. ""Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background.""

De Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. In
Our Lady of Peace
(1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while in
The Poor Man who Saved the City
(1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, in
The Red Cross
(1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves – a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. ""You must never praise war,"" De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book of
""automatic writing""
co-authored with her husband. ""The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors.""
Good and evil
The idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. ""Spiritualism was quite popular,"" asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – the creator of Sherlock Holmes – as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were ""probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world"". Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed.

Death is a recurring theme in the artist's work – in Love's Passing (1883-4) mortality is shown as a dark angel holding a scythe (Credit: Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation)
For De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. In
Earthbound
(1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while in
The Barred Gate
(c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven.
Often with her apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm – Jean McMeakin
With the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. In
Blindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City
(1897), for example, ""Cupidity"" is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away ""Joy"" in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls.
In
The Prisoner
(1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support for
universal suffrage
(Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs in
Luna
(1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny.
Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation

Christened ""Mary"", Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. ""She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers,"" says McMeakin. ""We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist,"" she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice.
Technically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure the
psychedelic painting styles
of the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place in
contemporary fantasy art
.
While art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. In
Lux in Tenebris
(light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife.

Watch: PM hails UK's ""biggest trade deal"" since Brexit
The UK and India have agreed a trade deal that will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports.
The British government said the ""landmark"" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and ""deliver for British people and business"".
Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled £42.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040.
India trade deal could undercut UK business, opposition parties say
India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was ""ambitious and mutually beneficial"".
The pact would help ""catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies"", he said in a post on social media platform X.
Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said.
That includes lower tariffs on:
clothing and footwear
cars
foodstuffs including frozen prawns
jewellery and gems
The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India.
UK exports that will see levies fall include:
gin and whisky
aerospace, electricals and medical devices
cosmetics
lamb, salmon, chocolates and biscuits
higher value cars
The British government said the deal was the ""biggest and most economically significant"" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020.
UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were ""massive"".
Tariffs on gin and whisky, a key sticking point in negotiations previously, will be halved to 75%, with further reductions taking effect in later years.
Tariffs of 100% on more expensive UK-made cars exported to India will fall to 10%, subject to a quota limiting the total number.
The deal also includes provisions on the services sector and procurement allowing British firms to compete for more contracts.
Under the terms of the deal, some Indian and British workers will also gain from a three-year exemption
from social security payments, which the Indian government called ""an unprecedented achievement"".
The exemption applies to the staff of Indian companies temporarily transferred to the UK, and to UK firms' workers transferred to India. Social security contributions will be paid by employers and employees in their home country only, rather than in both places.
The UK already has similar reciprocal ""double contribution convention"" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea, the government said.
However,
leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch described the agreement as ""two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir""
, with Labour's increase in employer NI contributions from the Budget coming into force last month.
Shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith said: ""Every time Labour negotiates, Britain loses"".
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it was ""very worrying to hear concerns that Indian workers coming over here, companies may not have to pay taxes on those workers"" and called for MPs to be allowed to vote on the deal.
The government said the National Insurance exemption would not affect NHS funding, since Indians working in the UK would still be required to pay the immigration health surcharge.
UK Department for Business and Trade
UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal met in London last week to finalise the deal
India, currently the fifth largest economy in the world, is forecast to become the  third-largest within in a few years, making it a desirable trading partner for the UK, currently the world's sixth largest economy.
The UK is also a high priority trading partner for Prime Minister Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to increase exports by $1 trillion by 2030.
The deal is a win for free trade at a time when US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff campaign has put the idea on the defensive and raised fears of tit-for-tat trade wars.
It appears to have increased the impetus to strike this trade deal.
Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of business lobby group, the CBI, welcomed the deal saying it provided a ""beacon of hope amidst the spectre of protectionism"" following Trump's wave of tariffs.
UK businesses saw ""myriad"" opportunities in the Indian market, she added.
Allie Renison, from communications firm SEC Newgate, and a former government trade adviser, said the deal was potentially  ""transformational"" due to India's size, growth rate and relatively high existing barriers to accessing its market.

A protester supporting transgender rights outside the US Supreme Court
The US Supreme Court temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to enforce his ban on transgender people  serving in the military while legal challenges to the policy move forward.
Shortly after taking office in January, Trump issued a pair of executive orders that cleared the way for the Pentagon to ban transgender troops from service.
But a lower court blocked the enforcement of the order in March, saying the administration had presented no information that transgender troops harmed the operation of the military.
In its emergency application to the court, the Trump administration argued that the lower court should show deference to the military's decision-making.
The court's three liberal justices objected to the stay, which arrived via an unsigned order on Tuesday.
Trump's executive order declared that identifying as transgender ""conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle"" and would hamper military preparedness.
In February, the Department of Defense announced it would force out transgender troops currently serving.
Seven servicemembers, including Commander Emily Schilling, a Navy fighter pilot, sued to block the ban. Another transgender person who wanted to join the military joined their lawsuit.
They argued the policies ""undermine military readiness, endanger our safety, and violate the United States Constitution"".
In March, a federal judge in Washington state ordered a nationwide halt on the administration's ban, saying the government failed to show it would enhance ""unit cohesion, good order or discipline"".
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did not block the lower court's ruling, keeping the injunction in place.
With the Supreme Court order, that pause will lift while the servicemembers' lawsuit makes its way through lower courts.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the order ""another massive victory in the Supreme Court"".

Businesses have found strange but legal ways to avoid Trump’s tariffs | CNN Business,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/06/economy/us-businesses-avoiding-tariffs,"A cargo ship arriving at the Port of Los Angeles.

A few months ago, the words “bonded warehouse” and “harmonized system codes” might not have been on the minds of many American business owners. Now they’re in a massive spotlight.
After President Donald Trump slapped a whopping 145% minimum tariff on most goods coming from China, 25% tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum and steel and a 10% tariff on almost every country’s imports, US businesses are desperate for ways to lower their import costs.
Two popular — and legal — strategies involve those bonded warehouses to defer tariffs and harmonized system codes to qualify for lower rates.
Ad Feedback
‘Tariff engineering’
There are over 5,000 different product classification codes that governments across the globe use when assessing tariffs.
Consumers don’t care whether the imported coat they’re wearing was officially classified as a windbreaker or a raincoat.
But for businesses, that distinction can be the difference between lower and higher tariff rates – and potentially turning a profit or not. And to qualify for the lower rate, all a manufacturer would have to do is tinker with the product’s materials, otherwise known as
tariff engineering
.
Ad Feedback
For instance, Converse’s signature All Stars sneakers have a sole that contains felt as opposed to the fully rubber one traditionally seen in sneakers. That may have been a purposeful decision, since foreign-produced shoes with felt bottoms could be considered “house slippers” for the purpose of tariff codes. And house slippers have qualified for significantly lower tariff rates compared to other kinds of footwear in the past. (Nike, the parent company of Converse, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment. CNN could not determine the latest tariff rates for sneakers versus house slippers given their respective classification codes.)
Columbia Sportswear has not been shy about its use of tariff engineering. “I have a whole team of people that work … with the designers and developers and merchandisers and with customs, actually, and to ensure that during the design process that we’re considering the impact of tariffs,” Jeff Tooze, the vice president of global customs and trade at Columbia Sportswear
told Marketplace
in 2019.
Among its uses of tariff engineering: adding small zippered pockets below shirt waistlines to qualify for lower tariff rates, he said.
Even in the current environment, with Trump’s efforts to target tariffs at China and specific sectors, there are still plenty of opportunities for businesses to tariff engineer products, said Erik Smithweiss, a partner at the law firm GDLSK, who specializes in trade compliance.
While there’s little way out of the initial 20% tariff Trump levied on China earlier this year, there are some opportunities to avoid the additional 125% that came into effect last month. That’s because Trump has, in some cases,
quietly exempted
some products from those tariffs.
“We are working with companies who say, ‘Gee, I really want to be on this list, look at my tariff codes,’” said Smithweiss. “If we think that there is something that can be modified on a product that will change it into one of these exempt codes, we’ll work with them on whether that is a reasonable position to take.”
But just slapping a new code on a product isn’t enough; the product itself has to be different in some way. US Customs and Border Protection agents can examine goods closely, including, for instance, sending fabrics out to labs to see if they meet applicable requirements, Smithweiss told CNN. If it doesn’t, the importer can be subject to a penalty on top of the higher tariff.
The name’s bond
The bonded warehouse route takes the opposite approach. Rather than mess with a good’s contents or move production elsewhere, businesses can import products from across the world without paying any tariffs when they enter the US — as long as they remain locked up in a special customs-regulated warehouse.
Businesses can keep goods in these warehouses for up to five years without paying a tariff. They only pay the current tariff rate when they take goods out of storage.
It’s a bet that tariff rates will go down in the short or medium term.
Jennifer Hartry, president of Howard Hartry, a customs broker that rents out bonded warehouses, told CNN’s Julia Vargas Jones that 95% of the inquiries she’s received are for goods coming from China.
Hartry said her family-owned business based by the Port of Los Angeles experienced a stark slowdown in recent years, but, since Trump introduced a slew of aggressive new tariffs, business has been booming.
There’s no limit to the monetary value of the goods stored in bonded warehouses — the only constraint is how much a business can fit in the space they’re renting.
For example, Hartry said the value of her tenants’ goods ranges from $37,000 to half a million dollars. Those goods include lithium batteries, metal rods and electronics such as TVs and treadmills.
Hartry said it’s not lost on her how much of a toll tariffs are taking on businesses. At the same time, she told CNN’s Vargas, “it’s saving our business, which we’re grateful for.","Published

It wasn’t the most contentious meeting the Oval Office has ever seen. Nor was it the warmest.
Instead,
the highly anticipated meeting
Tuesday between President Donald Trump and his new Canadian counterpart Mark Carney fell somewhere in the middle: neither openly hostile nor outwardly chummy, evincing very little neighborliness, at least the type used on neighbors one likes.
The midday talks illustrated neatly the new dynamic between the once-friendly nations, whose 5,525-mile border — the world’s longest — once guaranteed a degree of cooperation but which, to Trump, represents something very different.
Ad Feedback

“Somebody drew that line many years ago with, like, a ruler, just a straight line right across the top of the country,” Trump said in the Oval Office as his meeting was getting underway. “When you look at that beautiful formation when it’s together – I’m a very artistic person, but when I looked at that, I said: ‘That’s the way it was meant to be.’”
That is not how Carney believes it was meant to be.
“I’m glad that you couldn’t tell what was going through my mind,” Carney told reporters later that day about the moment Trump made that remark.
Ad Feedback
Still, Carney didn’t entirely hold his tongue.
In a meeting dominated by Trump’s comments — he spoke 95% of the time on all manner of topics, from the Middle East to Barack Obama’s presidential library to the state of high-speed rail in California — it was the new prime minister’s pushback on the president’s ambition to make Canada the 51st US state that stood out.
“As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” he said, drawing a begrudging “that’s true” from Trump before Carney carried on.

Carney tells Trump: Canada isn't for sale
02:32
“We’re sitting in one right now. You know, Buckingham Palace that you visited as well,” he continued, as Trump nodded another “true.”
“And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months, it’s not for sale,” he concluded. “It won’t be for sale ever.”
With that statement, Carney essentially accomplished what he’d come to Washington to do, stating in the clearest terms possible that Canada would not be annexed by its southern neighbor.
Of course, he’s been saying that for weeks, most vocally during last month’s federal election in Canada that saw his Liberals mount a shocking come-from-behind win riding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment.
Before arriving at the White House, Carney also sought to send the message by announcing an upcoming visit from King Charles III, Canada’s official head of state, using the sovereign to make the point that Canada’s sovereignty wasn’t up for debate.
Those messages, if he’s heard them, have not caused Trump to back off, not even when sitting across from Carney in the Oval Office.
“Never say never,” Trump shrugged, as Carney mouthed the word “never” over and over next to him. “I’ve had many, many things that were not doable, and they ended up being doable, and only doable in a very friendly way.”
Still, the president didn’t press the matter further, and the meeting did not fall off the rails. For a topic that has caused so much visceral anger in Canada, the issue was essentially defused, for the time being, in the Oval Office.
After reporters left the room, Carney told Trump it was not “useful” to repeat his idea of annexing Canada.
“But he is the president,” he said recalling the exchange at a solo press conference after the meeting ended, “and he will say what he wants.”
Trump hasn’t, however, deployed the insult against Carney that he used against his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. “As far as calling him Governor Carney, no, I haven’t done that yet — and maybe I won’t,” Trump said at an unrelated White House event later in the day.
Carney said they’d agreed to meet again next month at the G7 summit he is hosting in Alberta, which Trump had
previously not committed to attend
.
Still, relations between Washington and Ottawa remain at their lowest point in memory.
As Carney was at Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, preparing to depart for his meeting with Trump, the president launched a broadside on Truth Social, declaring Canada was overly dependent on the United States.
“We don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain,” Trump wrote. “They, on the other hand, need EVERYTHING from us!”
By the time Carney arrived, however, Trump seemed uninterested in having a public fight.
“We have some tough points to go over, and that’ll be fine,” Trump said after praising Carney for “one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics.”

See Trump's answer when asked about lifting Canadian tariffs
01:36
The meeting ended somewhat abruptly with Trump declaring the US did not need Canadian cars or steel, and that there was nothing Carney could say or do that would cause him to lift tariffs.
“Just the way it is,” Trump said.
But by the standards of the Trump White House, where another leader was berated and evicted in the Oval Office earlier this year, it was all relatively mild.
Even Trump acknowledged he’d seen worse.
“We had another little blow up with somebody else,” Trump said, a veiled allusion to his fight with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “That was a much different. This is, this is a very friendly conversation.”","Updated

I’ve no idea how it happened, but Inter Milan has beaten Barcelona in one of the most amazing soccer matches ever.
This grand old stadium has seen some magical moments over the years, but few can compare to what it’s just witnessed over the last 120 minutes.
Inter players embrace each other in tears, while the

faithful go crazy in the stands.
Barcelona’s stars are stunned. Some can barely lift themselves off the turf. They were mere seconds away from the final before Inter launched one of the most incredible comebacks in Champions League history.

That is simply sensational from Inter Milan keeper Yann Sommer.
Lamine Yamal cuts in from the right and looks to curl a shot into the far corner. Most people in the San Siro thought it was heading in, but Sommer springs into action and tips the effort around the post.
That could be a game-winning stop. Less than five minutes left.

There must be some really tired legs out there, but Inter and Barcelona are still going for it.
Sometimes, you get the sense that both teams are just waiting for extra-time to end and playing for penalties – but that’s certainly not the case today.
The San Siro has been rocking since Davide Frattesi put Inter back in front and you would expect the second half of extra-time to be all Barcelona as Hansi Flick’s side go in search of another equalizer in this incredible tie.
Although, I’ve given up predicting what might happen next in this tie.

So far in our D.I.Y. series, we’ve
hung things on walls
,
patched the holes we’ve made
, and
fixed squeaky floors
. It’s time to have a little fun. This month, we’ll bring some old furniture back to life.
You probably have a piece of furniture that’s in need of a little T.L.C. — a family heirloom, or a favorite table that’s looking a little battered. The desk I’m restoring here was a curb rescue, and it really was in poor looks when I found it — all the worse after spending a night in the rain. But as soon as I touched it I could tell it was wonderfully well made, and I loved its simple lines and balanced proportions.

To revive it, I had to go through all four steps of a complete furniture restoration: clean, repair, recolor and refinish. And there’s no getting around it: It took some time and patience. But it didn’t take any particular skill or specialized tools. I’m confident you can do it. And you can break up the work to fit your schedule.

The good news is, few restorations require nearly so much effort. Most need nothing more than a thorough wipe-down, a few touch-ups with stain to conceal minor damage, and a bit of wax to bring back the original luster.
In fact, if there’s one lesson to keep top of mind during any restoration project, it’s that going too far is the fatal mistake. Old furniture is beautiful because its shows its age. Tabletops fade to gold in the sun. Chair arms darken where hands have touched them. My desk was originally a uniform amber tone; its rich patina came from decades of service in New York classrooms.

People who question whether the Earth is round — a fact understood by the ancient Greeks and taught to American children in elementary school — might have been political pariahs a decade ago. Now, they’re running local Republican parties in
Georgia
and
Minnesota
and seeking public office in
Alabama
.
A prominent far-right activist who has said, despite years of
research and intelligence
establishing
otherwise
, that the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, were
an inside job
by the U.S. government
commemorated the 9/11 anniversary
last year alongside President Trump.
And
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,
pledged the agency’s
support last month for a fight involving so-called
chemtrails
, a
debunked theory
that the
white condensation lines
streaming behind airplanes are toxic, or could even be used for nefarious purposes.
Conspiracy theories that were relegated to random and often anonymous online forums are now being championed or publicly debated by increasingly powerful people. Mr. Trump in particular has embraced, elevated and even appointed to his cabinet people
promoting these theories
— giving the ideas a persuasive authority and a dangerous proximity to policy.

“The real problem with the ideas and the communication of conspiracy theories is when they get evinced by people with the power to act on them,” said Joseph E. Uscinski, a professor at the University of Miami who studies conspiracy theories. “If some guy, somewhere, thinks the Earth is flat, the answer is ‘So what?’ But when people in power have those beliefs, it becomes a serious issue.”
He added: “You can wind up harming many, many people over a fantasy.”
Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the White House, said in a statement that the mainstream media “has tried and failed to paint President Trump as extreme for his entire political career” and that his agenda was “common sense.”

A Ukrainian drone attack halted flights at airports across a wide swath of Russia overnight on Tuesday, Russian officials said, showing Kyiv’s ability to strike deep into Russian territory before a planned parade in Moscow to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.
Air defenses responded to the drone volley in at least 11 regions, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported. The attack closed 13 airports, including all four major airports serving Moscow, according to a Russian aviation agency. Flights resumed Tuesday morning.
The Ukrainian authorities have not commented on the strikes.
It was unclear whether the barrage was intended to threaten the parade, because Kyiv has been routinely shooting at Russia with long-range drones, answering the nightly Russian bombardments of Ukraine. Russian drones on Tuesday hit the cities of Sumy, Kharkiv and Odesa, killing four people and wounding at least another 24, according to local officials.
Russia has said about 20 heads of state including China’s president, Xi Jinping, have accepted invitations to the parade, in Red Square, on Friday; President Vladimir V. Putin has asked for a three-day truce in the war for the occasion.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has rejected that proposal unless Russia agrees to
extend any cease-fire
for at least 30 days, calling the shorter truce too limited. He has also said that the cease-fire was offered only to put guests of the parade at ease.

Your hips are your body’s powerhouse. You rely on them to jump, run, pick up bags of groceries and get in and out of your car. But if your hips or their surrounding muscles are tight or weak, other parts of your body — from your ankles to your lower back — have to step in to handle the load. That
imbalance
can make even the simplest activities challenging or painful.
“You can think of it like driving a car with the emergency brake on,” said Ryan Matisko, a physical therapist in New York City. This can lead to inefficient movement and an increased risk of injury.
Sitting for long stretches of time is a common cause of weak hips. In that position,
your glute muscles are turned off
, your blood flow is restricted and your hip flexors become shortened and tight. Mobility exercises can help
counteract that stiffness and tension
by moving your hip joint through its full range of motion, said Nicole Thompson, a personal trainer and group fitness instructor in San Diego.
For long-term hip health, you also need to strengthen the muscles that move your hips, like the glutes, hamstrings, hip flexors and adductors. “Mobility without strength is like a bridge without support beams,” Dr. Matisko said.

The following routine includes a combination of hip mobility and strength exercises. Practicing it consistently can help you move more efficiently in daily life and perform better in workouts, Ms. Thompson said.

The Zimbabwean singer who found fame in China – and obscurity at home
Jo Stak used to sing in Mandarin and get stopped by fans on the streets of Shanghai. That changed when he came home.

Harare, Zimbabwe –
It was 2017 and Jo Stak – wearing a red tuxedo jacket, a bow tie and a homburg hat – was belting out a Mandarin song.
Red and yellow lights shimmered around him as a crowd of cheering, flag-waving fans on the Chinese version of The Voice gave a standing ovation at the end of his act.
Stak’s melodious rendition of a 1992 Chinese song called The World Needs Warm Hearts was broadcast on national television.
“I was invited to perform at The Voice as a guest performer that year,” Stak recalls.
The prime-time spot reflected how well-known he’d become in China. On Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, he had about five million followers. He’d appeared on some of the country’s biggest television stations. Fans stopped him on the street to ask for a photo or just have a chat. The Zimbabwean singer was riding high.
“Being Black in China makes you stand out naturally,” he explains. “And I was a musician [so that] made me stand out more.”

The people who stopped him were often impressed that a foreigner would sing in Mandarin.

Some ‘big deal’
Today, in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, Joe Takawira – Stak’s real name – is an inconspicuous figure walking down a street in Budiriro 5, the working class suburb where he was born and raised. In 2019, after seven years in China, his work visa expired, and he returned home.

Sporting his signature beard, grey sweatpants, sneakers and a black T-shirt, he lights a cigarette.
He saunters past street vendors selling fresh produce and condiments, stops at a corner to chat with a friend, then goes about his day. Whenever he runs into someone he knows, he greets them with a fist bump and a toothy grin.
When he’s at home, Stak listens to instrumental music and writes songs in Mandarin.
“This is how I spend my time in Budiriro,” he says, shrugging.
It feels a long way from China and the career he enjoyed there. He has not found the same acclaim back home.
Even his neighbours had no idea about his previous life.
Clemence Kadzomba, who runs a tyre shop in Stak’s neighbourhood, had no idea who his neighbour was until some of his clients who were among the 20,000 Zimbabweans living in China recognised him.
“I couldn’t believe it,” 43-year-old Kadzomba says, grinning.
“They were so excited to see him, like he was some big deal. And yet, here he was, just hanging out with us like it was nothing.”

Unexpected journey to stardom
Stak’s musical journey has its roots in the Methodist church-run school he attended as a teenager.
He sang in his church choir, something he loved, and was part of a group of students who recorded a gospel album.
The album did well, and some of the songs have close to a million views on YouTube.
Music runs in his family, says Stak, the middle of three brothers. His older brother wrote songs at school while the youngest brother plays the piano.

After graduating, Stak enrolled to study Mandarin in China in 2012, motivated by his love for Chinese culture, which began as a boy watching Jackie Chan’s action films. He was 20 years old when he moved to Shanghai.
This came at a time when Zimbabwe was pivoting away from the West with the late leader Robert Mugabe’s “Look East” policy, adopted in response to United States and European Union sanctions after a 2002 presidential election marred by violence.
Mugabe opened Zimbabwe’s doors to Asia, leading to an influx of Chinese investment as more Zimbabweans headed to China to work or study.
By 2014, Stak was proficient in Mandarin and started posting videos of himself singing in Mandarin to Douyin. “I wanted to explore music in a different language,” he explains as he lights a cigarette and sits back in his chair on the red-floored veranda of his house.
He would sing R&B, hip-hop and pop songs in Mandarin and English and started to get booked for gigs.
“My first gig was at Yuyingtang, a music bar in Shanghai,” he recalls. He says the venue wasn’t very big but he made $1,500 – enough to pay for his food and accommodation for months.
That gig made him realise he could make money from his talent, and it marked the start of his career as a professional pop singer in China.
After that, he played at music bars, festivals, weddings and nightclubs – performing mostly in Mandarin.
Of the 37 songs he recorded, one was in the top 10 on the Chinese music streaming service Baidu Music. “It meant a lot to me,” Stak says excitedly, although it earned him only 5,000 yuan ($865).

Then in 2017, he joined the Foundation Band, a group of musicians from Africa, the US and Europe that performed Chinese and Western pop music and hip-hop at weddings and nightclubs.
As the lead vocalist, he caught the attention of Chinese television networks, leading to performances on major stations.
“I was surprised by my success in China,” Stak admits.
Life there was good. His daily routine consisted mainly of “eating, singing and drinking”.
His favourite dish was hotpot – a meal for which diners cook raw ingredients like seafood and tofu in a shared pot of broth at the table.
“Even now, when I miss it, I go to Chinese restaurants,” he says.
He’d perform at night, and during the day, he’d roam along Shanghai’s historic waterfront with its colonial-era architecture and rooftop bars.
Stak made good money. “They pay artists well – I mean 1,000 US dollars minimum for a 10-minute show.”
But he also felt accepted and at home in China, where he says the music industry welcomes foreign talent and invests in it.
Unlike many foreign artists singing in English who can struggle to break into the Chinese market, Stak had an edge – he was an African singing in Mandarin, and there were few performers like him. His ability to perform popular Chinese songs endeared him to audiences.

Coming home to anonymity
Then in 2019, Stak’s visa expired. Aged 27, he returned to a country that was in the midst of a
devastating economic crisis
.
Advertisement
His parents – his father’s an engineer, his mother’s a teacher – were coping, but across the country, people were struggling with hyperinflation, foreign currency shortages and an unemployment rate of more than 50 percent.
Stak found work as a translator – and quickly discovered that Zimbabwe’s music and social media landscapes were unfamiliar to him.
He says much of his fame and success came from Chinese apps, mostly Douyin. But the apps he relied on are available only in China as Beijing restricts foreign digital platforms through its “
Great Firewall
”.
Without them, Stak could no longer reach his Chinese audience.
His career vanished when he left Shanghai. “I feel like a part of me remained in China,” he explains.
In Zimbabwe, nobody knew him. He started recording some music – and contemplated a switch to gospel, which is popular in the country – but he’s struggled to promote his songs. When he contacted a local radio station to play his music, he never heard back.
Stak believes that if Chinese social media were accessible to global audiences, he would still have a thriving musical career.
“That would have brought me international recognition,” he says.
For now, the translation work pays well. He currently works for a Chinese mining company, translating English or Shona into Mandarin. When he isn’t working, he tries to write music, but full-time work leaves little time to reinvent himself or find an audience for his Chinese pop.
Longing for the stage
Today, Stak is torn. He dreams of a return to China but also wants to rebuild his music career in Zimbabwe, where he hopes to marry and raise a family.

“I want to start afresh here,” he says.
“But I also miss China,” a country that was “very good and welcoming” to him, he adds.
Whether it’s in Asia or Africa, he itches to return to the stage. “I miss the spotlight,” he says.
Five years after he left China, Stak remains popular there. A couple of months ago, his Chinese boss uploaded a video of him singing in Mandarin. “[He] posted me on his WeChat status, and people were asking him about me. They were like, ‘Where is this guy?’”
Stak takes a moment and then adds, “The Chinese love me.”

The fight for land justice in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and across the Global South is not just a local struggle – it is a global one
The international response to Zimbabwe's land reform programme was swift and punitive. When the US Congress passed ZDERA in December 2001, it was explicitly presented as a response to Zimbabwe’s land reform programme, framing Zimbabwe’s actions as a threat to US foreign policy.
In
this
article co-authored by Elizabeth Mpfou, Raj Patel and Varsha Gandikota-Nellutla for Al Jazeera in early April, they write about Zimbabwe’s land reform that challenged colonial injustices but triggered harsh Western sanctions that devastated its economy.
On February 7, the White House cut aid to South Africa, citing a nonexistent threat to white farmers from government land expropriation. To see what might lie beyond Trump’s executive order, South Africa need only look north. Zimbabwe’s economy has been crushed by sanctions imposed after redistributing colonial-era farmland. And despite efforts to placate the development establishment, it appears that Washington prefers the country to dangle, like a corpse in a gibbet, lest other countries start getting ideas of their own.
In July 2020, in the teeth of the COVID-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe agreed to pay $3.5bn in compensation to approximately 4,000 white settler landowners for property redistributed during land reforms. This sum, five times the size of Zimbabwe’s
May 2020 COVID stimulus plan
, was pledged at a time when the United Nations warned the country was “on the brink of man-made starvation”.
The deal came after years of pressure, with Zimbabwean officials hoping it would persuade the United States to lift the punitive 2001 Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) that has blocked the nation’s access to international loans and assistance for two decades. Yet Zimbabwe lacked the funds to pay, and ZDERA remained.
The conventional narrative portrays Zimbabwe’s land reform as reckless expropriation by the despotic Robert Mugabe, leading to economic collapse. This version rewrites history. During British colonisation, Africans were prohibited from owning land outside “native reserves”. By the mid-20th century, 48,000 white settlers controlled 50 million acres (more than 20 million hectares) of prime farmland, while nearly a million Africans were confined to 20 million acres of largely infertile land – an injustice that fuelled Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle.
For two decades, Zimbabwe has been trapped in a cycle of economic isolation, unable to access the loans and investment needed to rebuild.
The 1979 Lancaster House Agreement, which ended white minority rule, restricted land reform to market transactions for a decade, ensuring colonial-era land ownership persisted. Despite this constraint, Zimbabwe made strides in human development in the 1980s. But by the end of the decade,
the World Bank and the IMF imposed an economic structural adjustment programme, slashing public spending, removing subsidies, and privatising state enterprises.
The result: mass unemployment, degraded services, and deepening poverty.
By 2000, facing growing domestic pressure, Mugabe’s government began compulsory land redistribution. The programme had flaws – inadequate support for new farmers and insufficient resources to rebuild agricultural supply chains. Yet, contrary to disaster narratives, thousands of landless Zimbabweans benefitted while a small elite of white settlers lost their privileged status.
The international response was swift and punitive. When the US Congress passed ZDERA in December 2001, it was explicitly presented as a response to Zimbabwe’s land reform programme, framing Zimbabwe’s actions as a threat to US foreign policy. The United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia, and Canada followed with their own punitive measures. For two decades, Zimbabwe has been trapped in a cycle of economic isolation, unable to access the loans and investment needed to rebuild.
The human cost has been staggering. UN human rights experts have repeatedly warned that ZDERA has had an “insidious ripple effect” on Zimbabwe’s economy and the enjoyment of fundamental rights. The Southern African Development Community estimates that Zimbabwe has lost access to more than $100bn in international support since 2001.
The 2020 compensation deal is a cruel irony. Zimbabwe, already bankrupt, must now borrow billions to pay former colonial beneficiaries, hoping to escape a punitive law imposed in response to its land reform programme. This creates a perfect trap: a nation forced to finance its subjugation, while its people suffer.
The absurdity is underscored by the US’s refusal to support Zimbabwe’s debt restructuring through the African Development Bank. US officials insist that ZDERA is “a law, not a sanction”, but this is a distinction without a difference – whether through formal sanctions or legislation, the goal remains the same: protecting settler property rights over justice for the colonised.
This is not just Zimbabwe’s story. The Trump administration recently attacked South Africa’s far more cautious land reform efforts, falsely claiming the government was “seizing land from white farmers”. This rhetoric, amplified by far-right media, ignores that South Africa’s land reform – a constitutionally mandated process – seeks to correct apartheid-era dispossession, where white South Africans, 8 percent of the population, control 72 percent of farmland.
Trump’s intervention was never about property rights – it was about preserving a global system that favours former colonisers over the dispossessed. The fight for land justice in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and across the Global South is not just a local struggle – it is a global one.
As Thomas Sankara, the revolutionary leader of Burkina Faso, once said, debt is “a cleverly managed reconquest of Africa”. Zimbabwe’s plight is a stark reminder of this truth. The international community must reckon with the legacy of colonialism and the systems that continue to enforce it. Until we do, the promise of liberation will remain out of reach for millions.
Zimbabwe’s land reform was not perfect, but it was necessary. The tragedy is not the reform itself but the global backlash punishing Zimbabwe for daring to challenge the status quo. It is time to lift the sanctions, cancel the debts, and allow Zimbabwe, South Africa, and other nations to pursue justice on their own terms. Land reform is not a threat – it is a demand for justice, one the world can no longer ignore.

Mnangagwa Declares Gutu East And Insiza North Constituencies Vacant
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has declared the Gutu East and Insiza North constituencies vacant following the expulsion and death of their former representatives, respectively.
The Gutu East constituency was held by Benjamin Ganyiwa, who was expelled from ZANU PF for acts of indiscipline, while Insiza North was represented by the late Farai Taruvinga, who passed away last month.
The President’s announcement followed a formal notification from the Speaker of Parliament, Advocate Jacob Mudenda, on 17 April, as set out in Proclamation 3 of 2025, which was published under Statutory Instrument 44A of 2025.
This proclamation was made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Zimbabwe and the Electoral Act.
The Nomination Courts for the constituencies are scheduled to convene on 15 May.

Explaining press traps in football
In modern football, pressing has become one of the most important defensive strategies.
Those who
enjoy 1xBet sports betting Uganda
can also wager on teams that have different strategies.
Within this system, “press traps” are a clever tactical tool teams use to regain possession high up the pitch. A press trap is essentially a deliberate setup by the defending team to lure the opponent into a specific area of the field, only to aggressively press him once they enter it. There are 3 objectives that can be achieved with this:
isolate the ball carrier;
limit his passing options;
and force a mistake.
Something to
enjoy
when making
sports betting
at
1xBet Uganda
is to wager on teams with great defensive setups.
How it works
Press traps often start by letting the opponent believe he has a safe passing route. Defenders may slightly back off or subtly invite a pass to a certain player or side. For example, a team might allow the opponent’s full-back to receive the ball near the touchline. Once the ball is played there, multiple players quickly swarm the receiver, doing 2 things: cutting off nearby options and boxing them in against the sideline, where there’s less space to maneuver. A
foot bet today
can be made at 1xBet on various things that happen during football matches too.
There are several types of press traps. One common version is the touchline trap, where the sideline acts as an “extra defender.” Another is the central trap, which is riskier but highly rewarding, where a team tempts the opponent to play into the middle before collapsing on the ball carrier. You are always invited to try a
foot
ball
bet today
at the 1xBet website on the best defenders from world football.
Some teams also use back pass traps, encouraging a pass to the goalkeeper or center-backs under pressure, leading to rushed clearances or turnovers.
Tricking the opponent
Executing a press trap successfully requires 3 ingredients:  coordination, communication, and timing. All pressing players must move as a unit to cut off passing lanes without leaving gaps elsewhere. If even 1 player mistimes the press, the opponent can easily break through and exploit the space left behind. A good reason to
register 1xBet
is to be able to bet on teams who succeed in using press traps.
Press traps are most famously used by teams that play high-energy, aggressive football, like Arne Slot’s Liverpool or Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. However, they are not limited to the top clubs. Even lower-league and youth teams use simplified versions of press traps to great effect. All football fans are invited to

at
1xBet
, where among other things, they will be able to bet on Liverpool, Manchester City and other teams too.
